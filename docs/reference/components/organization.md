An Organization is the top-level entity within Greenhouse. Each Organization represents a different tenant within Greenhouse and is provided with a dedicated Namespace in the Greenhouse cluster.

## Example Organization Spec

```yaml
apiVersion: greenhouse.sap/v1alpha1
kind: Organization
metadata:
  name: example-organization
spec:
  authentication:
    oidc:
      issuer: https://accounts.example.com
      clientId: example-client-id
```

## Writing an Organization Spec

### DisplayName

`.spec.displayName` is a human-friendly name for the Organization. This field is optional; if not provided, it defaults to the value of `metadata.name`.

### Authentication

#### OIDC

`.spec.authentication.oidc` is used to configure how members of the Organization will authenticate to Greenhouse. Greenhouse IDProxy is using [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) to provide the OIDC authentication for multiple Organizations. Each Organization receives their own Dex connector.

The config requires `issuer`, the URL of the identity provider, and `clientIDReference` and `clientSecretReference`, which reference Kubernetes Secrets containing the OIDC client ID and client secret, respectively.

```yaml
spec:
  authentication:
    oidc:
      issuer: https://accounts.example.com
      clientIdReference:
        name: oidc-client-id-secret
        key: client-id
      clientSecretReference:
        name: oidc-client-secret
        key: client-secret
```

`.authentication.oidc.redirectURI` is an optional field to specify a custom redirect URI for OIDC authentication. If not provided, it defaults to the Greenhouse ID Proxy (`auth.<greenhouse domain name>`).

`.authentication.oidc.oauth2ClientRedirectURIs` is an optional list of URIs that are added to the Dex connector as allowed redirect URIs for OAuth2 clients.

#### SCIM

`.spec.authentication.scim` is used by Greenhouse to retrieve the members of a Team from the Organization's identity provider. This field is optional; if not provided, Greenhouse will not attempt to sync users via SCIM.

The configuration requires `baseURL`, the URL of the SCIM endpoint, and `authType`, which specifies the authentication method to use when connecting to the SCIM endpoint. Supported methods are `basic` and `token`.

```yaml
spec:
  authentication:
    scim:
      baseURL: https://scim.example.com
      authType: token
      bearerToken:
        secret:
          name: scim-bearer-token-secret
          key: bearer-token
      bearerPrefix: Bearer
      bearerHeader: Authorization
```

`.authentication.scim.bearerPrefix` is an optional field to specify a custom prefix for the bearer token in the authorization header. If not provided, it defaults to `Bearer`.

`.authentication.scim.bearerHeader` is an optional field to specify a custom header name for the bearer token. If not provided, it defaults to `Authorization`.

### MappedOrgAdminIdPGroup

`.spec.mappedOrgAdminIdPGroup` is an optional field that specifies the name of an identity provider group whose members will be granted Organization Admin privileges within Greenhouse. If this field is not provided, no users will be granted Organization Admin privileges.

## Working with Organizations

### Role-Based Access Control within the Organization namespace

Greenhouse provisions a set of default Roles and RoleBindings within each Organization's Namespace to facilitate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These roles can be used by the Organization Admins as a starting point to manage access to resources within their Organization.

The following roles are seeded for each Organization:

| Name                            | Description                                                | ApiGroups                 | Resources                                                                                            | Verbs                       | Cluster scoped |
