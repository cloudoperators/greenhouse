        ClusterKubeconfig is the Schema for the clusterkubeconfigs API
        ObjectMeta.OwnerReferences is used to link the ClusterKubeconfig to the Cluster
        ObjectMeta.Generation is used to detect changes in the ClusterKubeconfig and sync local kubeconfig files
        ObjectMeta.Name is designed to be the same with the Cluster name

            ClusterKubeconfigSpec stores the kubeconfig data for the cluster
            The idea is to use kubeconfig data locally with minimum effort (with local tools or plain kubectl):
