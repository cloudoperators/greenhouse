Greenhouse enables organizations to register their Kubernetes clusters within the platform, providing a centralized interface for managing and monitoring these clusters.   
Once registered, users can perform tasks related to cluster management, such as deploying applications, scaling resources, and configuring access control, all within the Greenhouse platform.

This section provides guides for the management of Kubernetes clusters within Greenhouse.
