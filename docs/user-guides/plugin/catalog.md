## Before you begin

This guides describes how to explore the catalog of Greenhouse _PluginDefinitions_.

While all members of an organization can see the _Plugin_ catalog, enabling, disabling and configuration _PluginDefinitions_ for an organization requires **organization admin privileges**.

## Exploring the _PluginDefinition_ catalog

The _PluginDefinition_ resource describes the backend and frontend components as well as mandatory configuration options of a Greenhouse extension.  
While the _PluginDefinition_ catalog is managed by the Greenhouse administrators and the respective domain experts, administrators of an organization can configure and tailor _Plugins_ to their specific requirements.

```text
NOTE: The UI also provides a preliminary catalog of Plugins under Organization> Plugin> Add Plugin.
```

1. Run the following command to see all available _PluginDefinitions_.

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get plugindefinition
