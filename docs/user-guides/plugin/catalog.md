## Before you begin

This guides describes how to use the Catalog API to fetch Greenhouse _PluginDefinitions_.

While all members of an organization can see the _Plugin_ catalog, enabling, disabling and configuring _PluginDefinitions_ for an organization requires **organization admin privileges**.

## Exploring Greenhouse PluginDefinition Catalog

Greenhouse provides a curated list of _PluginDefinitions_ that can be installed in your organization namespace.
These _PluginDefinitions_ are stored in the [greenhouse-extensions](https://github.com/cloudoperators/greenhouse-extensions) GitHub repository.

Each extension has a `plugindefintion.yaml` file that describes the extension.

A full reference of available `PluginDefinitions` can be found in [Plugin Catalog](./../../../reference/catalog)
