This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough for new users to navigate the initial stages of the Greenhouse platform. 

## Sign up

You're an **administrator and organization lead** and want to register for Greenhouse?  
We got you covered!

During phase 1 and 2 of the roadmap Greenhouse is only open to selected early adopters.  
Please reach out to the Greenhouse team to register and create your organization via [**Slack**](https://convergedcloud.slack.com/archives/C04Q0QM40KF) or [**DL Greenhouse**](https://profiles.wdf.sap.corp/groups/651c1087132d08d3d8fac2e5/users).

Prerequisites:
1. **CAM Profile**  
    A CAM profile is required to configure the administrators of the organization.  
    Please include the name of the profile in the message to the Greenhouse team when signing up.


2. **SAP ID service**  
    The authentication for the users belonging to your organization is based on the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard.  
    For SAP, we recommend using a SAP ID service (IDS) tenant.  
    Please include the parameters for your tenant in the message to the Greenhouse team when signing up.

    If you don't have a SAP ID Service tenant yet, please refer to the [SAP ID Service](../../user-guides/organization/sap-id) section for more information.
